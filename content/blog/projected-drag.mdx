Ever wonder how iOS achieves that satisfying scroll momentum? Or how Figma's drag interactions feel so natural? The secret is **projected drag**—calculating where an element would land based on its release velocity, then animating smoothly to that destination.

## The Core Concept

When you flick a list on your phone, it doesn't just stop when you lift your finger. It *slides* to a projected destination based on how fast you were scrolling. This creates a feeling of physical weight and momentum that makes digital interfaces feel tangible.

The physics are surprisingly simple: given a velocity and a deceleration rate, we can calculate exactly where an object would come to rest.

## Try It Yourself

Before we dive into the code, play with this interactive demo. Drag the pink element quickly and release—watch how it slides to its projected destination. If you fling it toward a drop zone, it'll snap into place.

import { ProjectedDrag } from "@/components/demos/ProjectedDrag";

<div className="md:hidden">
  <ProjectedDrag className="my-8" showDebug={true} />
</div>

## Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's build this from scratch. The implementation involves three key pieces: velocity tracking, projection calculation, and spring animation.

import { projectedDragSteps } from "./projected-drag.steps";

<Scrolly steps={projectedDragSteps} />

## Key Takeaways

Building projected drag taught me several important lessons about motion design:

### 1. Physics Creates Believability
The projection formula isn't arbitrary—it models real-world deceleration. When digital objects follow physical laws, they feel tangible even without haptic feedback.

### 2. Inherit Momentum
The key to natural-feeling animations is passing the release velocity into the spring config. This creates continuity between the gesture and the animation.

### 3. Combine Projection with Intent
Raw projection gives you physics. Combining it with drop zones or snap points gives you intentional UX. The best interactions balance organic feel with predictable outcomes.

### 4. Visual Feedback Matters
The subtle scale and rotation during drag aren't just decorative—they communicate that the system is responding to your input in real-time.

## Going Further

This pattern opens up many possibilities:

- **Inertial scrolling** for custom scroll containers
- **Swipe-to-dismiss** with momentum-based thresholds
- **Drag-and-drop** with predictive drop zone highlighting
- **Canvas interactions** like panning and zooming with inertia

The foundation is always the same: track velocity, calculate projection, animate with springs. From there, you can build interactions that feel as natural as the native platform.
