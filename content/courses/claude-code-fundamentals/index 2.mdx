## A Context-First Course

Claude Code is powerful, but the real unlock isn't a command - it's how you manage context. This course starts with that foundation, then builds toward practical workflows: projects, MCP servers, hooks, and team-ready patterns.

<InlineTOC />

## What You'll Learn

- How context windows actually work (and how to budget them)
- A clean, repeatable setup for any project
- The smallest set of commands that carry 80% of the workflow
- When to use MCP servers vs. simple CLI commands
- How to scale with subagents, hooks, and memory files
- How to keep your workflow updated when Claude Code changes

## Course Modules

**Module 0: Context Primer**
Learn what "context" really is, how it fills up, and why it impacts quality and cost.

**Module 1: Foundations**
Install Claude Code, set up `CLAUDE.md`, and build the right habits early.

**Module 2: Core Features**
Permissions, planning, slash commands, and a practical approach to MCP.

**Module 3: Power Features**
Subagents, GitHub integration, and hooks for automation.

**Module 4: Production Patterns**
Session memory, delegation patterns, and durable workflows.

**Module 5: Changelog & Infrastructure**
How Claude Code is built, how it evolves, and how to stay current.

## Who This Is For

- Developers new to Claude Code
- Teams building consistent AI workflows
- Anyone who wants practical, minimal systems over "vibe coding"

## Course Philosophy

This course favors clarity over hype. You'll learn workflows you can trust, not just commands you can memorize.

**Three guiding ideas:**
- Keep context lean
- Stay in the loop
- Automate the boring parts
