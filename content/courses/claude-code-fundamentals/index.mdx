## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes **understanding over memorization**. You'll learn not just what commands to run, but why certain patterns work better than others and how to adapt them to your specific workflow.

We focus on:
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, layer on advanced concepts
- **Production-ready patterns** - Real workflows, not toy examples
- **Context management** - The key skill that separates good from great AI usage
- **Staying in the loop** - AI assists, you remain in control
