## The Tool That Changed How I Work

Imagine an assistant that can read your codebase, run your tests, edit your files, and explain what it's doing at every step. Now imagine it lives in your terminal, right where you already work.

That's Claude Code. It's not a chatbot with a code snippet feature. It's an **agentic coding tool** that takes actions on your behalf: reading files, running commands, making edits, and explaining its reasoning as it goes.

You already understand context from the previous lesson. Now you're going to put that knowledge to work with a real tool.

<InlineTOC />

## What Claude Code Actually Is

Let's get precise. Claude Code is a **terminal-native AI agent**. That means:

- It runs in your terminal (not a browser, not a VS Code panel)
- It can **read** your files, **edit** them, **run commands**, and **search** your codebase
- It asks before doing anything risky
- It works with any language, any framework, any project

Think of it like pair programming with someone who has read the documentation for every tool you use, but needs you to point them at the right files and explain the goal clearly. That's where your context skills come in.

## Install Claude Code

There are three installation paths. The native installer is the one you want.

**Recommended: Native installer (auto-updates)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

This gives you automatic updates and the fastest startup time. It's the path the Claude Code team actively maintains.

**Alternative: Homebrew**

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Works fine, but you'll need to manually update.

**Legacy: npm (deprecated)**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

<Callout type="warning" title="NPM installs are deprecated">
If you're currently using the npm install, run `claude install` inside a Claude Code session to migrate to the native path. The npm package will eventually stop receiving updates.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Avoid sudo for npm">
If you're on the npm path, never use `sudo npm install -g`. It creates permission issues that will haunt you later. Fix your npm prefix instead.
</Callout>

## Your First Run

Open your terminal, navigate to a project directory, and type:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

That's it. Claude Code will scan your project structure, load any `CLAUDE.md` file it finds, and wait for your first prompt.

If you want to verify the installation is healthy:

```bash
claude doctor
```

This checks your authentication, your environment, and your configuration. Run it whenever something feels off.

## Your First Prompt

Here's where the context lesson pays off immediately. Your first prompt should be **small, specific, and verifiable**.

Bad first prompt:

```
Refactor my entire codebase to use TypeScript.
```

This is a massive, unbounded task. Claude will thrash, and you won't be able to verify the output.

Good first prompt:

```
Show me the main entry point of this app and explain how it starts.
```

Watch what happens:
1. Claude reads only the files it needs (not your whole repo)
2. It explains what it found clearly
3. It doesn't make any changes unless you ask

This is the **read-first, act-later** pattern you'll use throughout this course. Let Claude explore, then direct it.

## Troubleshooting Decision Framework

Things go wrong. Here's how to fix the most common issues quickly.

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `command not found: claude` | Not installed or not in PATH | Re-run the install script, then restart your terminal |
| Authentication loop | Expired or missing API key | Run `claude` again and re-authenticate |
| Slow startup | Large project scan | Add a `.claudeignore` file (works like `.gitignore`) |
| "Context too long" errors | Too much loaded at once | Start a fresh session with fewer files |
| Permission denied | npm installed with sudo | Uninstall, fix npm prefix, reinstall without sudo |

<Callout type="info" title="The .claudeignore File">
If your project has large directories Claude doesn't need (like `node_modules`, `dist`, or `.git`), create a `.claudeignore` file at your project root. It uses the same syntax as `.gitignore`. This speeds up startup and keeps irrelevant files out of context.
</Callout>

## Try It Yourself

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Install Claude Code** using the native installer above.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Navigate to a real project** you're working on. Don't use an empty folder. Pick something with actual code.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Run `claude`** and authenticate if prompted.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Ask your first question:** "What is the main entry point of this project and what does it do?"
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Observe the tool calls.** Watch which files Claude reads. Notice how it picks just the files it needs, not everything.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Ask a follow-up:** "What dependencies does this project use?" See how Claude builds on the existing context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Pay attention to the flow: Claude reads, thinks, and reports. It doesn't guess. And it doesn't modify anything unless you tell it to.

## What You Learned

- Claude Code is a **terminal-native AI agent**, not a chatbot
- The **native installer** is the recommended path (auto-updates, fastest startup)
- Your first prompt should be **small, specific, and read-only**
- The **read-first, act-later** pattern prevents mistakes and builds trust
- `.claudeignore` keeps large, irrelevant directories out of your context

Next, you'll create your first `CLAUDE.md` file, the persistent instruction set that teaches Claude Code about your specific project.
