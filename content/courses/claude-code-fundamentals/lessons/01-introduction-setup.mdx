## Where Claude Code Fits (After Context)

You already know how context works. Claude Code is simply the tool that lets you apply that context to real codebases: read files, run commands, and make edits - all from your terminal.

## Install Claude Code

**Recommended (native installer)**

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

**Fallback (npm)**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

<Callout type="info" title="Keep it clean">
Avoid using `sudo` for npm installs - it often causes permission issues later.
</Callout>

## First Run

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

You'll authenticate once, then Claude Code will scan your project and wait for your first prompt.

## Your First Prompt

Try something small and specific:

```
Show me the main entry point of this app and explain how it starts.
```

Watch the flow:
- Claude reads only what it needs
- It reports back clearly
- It waits for confirmation before changing anything

## Key Takeaways

- Claude Code is a terminal-first AI assistant for codebases
- Native install is the simplest path
- Start small, stay focused, and build from there
