## What Subagents Are

Subagents are specialized Claude instances with their **own context** and **their own tool limits**. They do a task, then report back to your main session with a concise summary.

## Why They Matter

- **Context isolation** keeps your main session clean
- **Specialization** produces better outputs
- **Safety** improves when tools are restricted

## Creating a Subagent

Define a subagent in `.claude/agents/` (or use the Agents UI if available). Give it a name, a role, and only the tools it needs.

## Example: Code Reviewer (Read-Only)

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs and edge cases
model: sonnet
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
---
```

This agent can't edit or run commands - perfect for reviews.

## Keep Agents Lean

A subagent doesn't need every tool or MCP server. Restricting tools keeps its own context smaller and its output sharper.

## Key Takeaways

- Subagents are isolated by design
- Limit their tools for focus and safety
- Treat them like specialists, not generalists
