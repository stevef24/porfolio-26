## What Are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized Claude instances that handle specific tasks. Each subagent has:

- **Its own context window** - Isolated from the main session
- **Custom system prompt** - Specialized expertise
- **Restricted tools** - Only what it needs
- **Model selection** - Choose capability level

Think of subagents as team members with specific roles. The main Claude Code session acts as a senior developer delegating to specialists.

## Why Use Subagents?

### Specialized Expertise
Each subagent can be fine-tuned for a specific task through detailed prompts.

### Context Isolation
Subagent work doesn't pollute your main session's context.

### Parallel Workflows
Multiple subagents can work on different aspects simultaneously.

### Tool Restriction
Limit what a subagent can do for safety (e.g., reviewer can't edit files).

## Creating Subagents

Open the agents menu:

```
/agents
```

Select "Create new agent" and choose:
1. **Scope** - Project or personal
2. **Generation** - Have Claude create or manual
3. **Description** - What this agent does

## Example: UX Reviewer Agent

Create a subagent that reviews UI components:

```
/agents → Create new agent → Project scope
```

Description:
```
Expert UI/UX engineer who reviews React components in a browser
using Playwright. Takes screenshots and provides feedback on
visual design, user experience, and accessibility.
```

Claude generates a markdown file in `.claude/agents/`:

```markdown
---
name: ux-reviewer
description: Reviews UI/UX of React components
model: sonnet
color: purple
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - mcp__playwright__*
---

# UX Reviewer Agent

You are an expert UI/UX engineer specializing in React applications.

## Workflow

1. Navigate to the component preview
2. Take screenshots at different viewport sizes
3. Analyze visual design, spacing, and hierarchy
4. Check accessibility (contrast, focus states, ARIA)
5. Provide actionable feedback

## Review Criteria

### Visual Design
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Typography hierarchy
- Color contrast ratios
- Visual balance

### User Experience
- Clear call-to-actions
- Intuitive interactions
- Loading and error states
- Responsive behavior

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels
```

## Configuring Agent Tools

Restrict tools in the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
---
```

This agent can only read code—it cannot edit files or run commands. Perfect for review workflows.

### Common Tool Configurations

| Use Case | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Code reviewer | Read, Glob, Grep |
| Test runner | Read, Bash (test commands only) |
| Documentation writer | Read, Write, Glob |
| Full developer | All tools |

## Invoking Subagents

Claude Code automatically delegates to subagents when appropriate. You can also invoke them explicitly:

```
Ask the ux-reviewer agent to review the new Button component
```

Or through custom commands:

`.claude/commands/ui-component.md`:
```markdown
Create a new React component called $1.

After creating the component:
1. Start the dev server
2. Invoke the ux-reviewer agent to review it
3. Implement the feedback
4. Request another review if needed
```

## Agent Communication

Subagents report back to the main session:

1. Main session delegates task
2. Subagent works in isolated context
3. Subagent returns summary/feedback
4. Main session continues with that information

The main session receives a condensed summary, not the full subagent context.

## Example: Test Writer Agent

```markdown
---
name: test-writer
description: Writes comprehensive tests
model: sonnet
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Glob
  - Bash
---

# Test Writer Agent

You write comprehensive tests for JavaScript/TypeScript code.

## Testing Philosophy

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Descriptive test names
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

## Coverage Goals

- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Integration points

## Commands

After writing tests, run:
```bash
pnpm test
```

Ensure all tests pass before completing.
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Agents Focused
One agent, one responsibility. Don't create a "do everything" agent.

### Restrict Tools Appropriately
Give agents only the tools they need. A reviewer shouldn't edit; a writer shouldn't run arbitrary commands.

### Use Descriptive Names
Agent names should indicate their purpose: `test-writer`, `security-auditor`, `ux-reviewer`.

### Version Control Agents
Store project agents in `.claude/agents/` and commit them. Team-wide consistency.

## Practice Exercise

1. Create a code reviewer agent via `/agents`
2. Restrict it to read-only tools
3. Ask it to review a file in your project
4. Note how it provides feedback without editing

## Key Takeaways

- Subagents are specialized Claude instances
- Each has isolated context and restricted tools
- Delegate specific tasks for better results
- Configure via `.claude/agents/` markdown files
- Main session receives summaries from subagents
