## Tools = Actions

Claude Code doesn't "type" on your behalf - it uses tools. Each tool is a specific action:

- **Read / Glob / Grep**: inspect files
- **Edit / Write**: modify files
- **Bash**: run commands
- **Task**: delegate to a subagent
- **WebSearch / WebFetch**: get external info

## The Permission Model

By default, Claude asks before any action that could change your system. That is a feature, not friction.

If you want to speed things up, you can allow specific commands or enable broader edit permissions.

## The Two Safe Defaults

**1. Allow known commands**

```
/permissions
```

Add a whitelist like:
- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm test`
- `git status`

**2. Keep destructive commands blocked**

Never auto-allow:
- `rm -rf`
- `git push --force`
- database drop commands

<Callout type="info" title="Sandbox mode">
You can run bash in a safer sandbox with `/sandbox` when you want extra isolation.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

- Tools are the real actions Claude performs
- You control the risk through permissions
- Start strict, then relax only when you trust the workflow
