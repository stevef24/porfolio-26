## Understanding Tools

Tools are the actions Claude Code can take in your environment. Each tool has a specific purpose:

### Read Tools
- **Read** - View file contents
- **Glob** - Find files by pattern
- **Grep** - Search file contents

### Write Tools
- **Edit** - Modify existing files
- **Write** - Create new files
- **NotebookEdit** - Edit Jupyter notebooks

### Execution Tools
- **Bash** - Run terminal commands
- **Task** - Spawn subagent for complex work

### Information Tools
- **WebFetch** - Retrieve web content
- **WebSearch** - Search the internet

## Permission Modes

Claude Code has different permission modes to balance productivity and safety:

### Default Mode
Claude asks permission for potentially dangerous actions:
- Running bash commands
- Writing or editing files
- Making external requests

This is the safest mode for getting started.

### Trust Project Commands
Allow specific commands without prompting:

```
/permissions
```

Then select "Allow command" and enter patterns like:
- `pnpm test` - Allow running tests
- `pnpm dev` - Allow starting dev server
- `git status` - Allow git status checks

### Accept Edits Mode
Trust Claude to make file edits without asking:

```
/permissions
```

Select "Accept all edits" for faster iteration when you're confident in your instructions.

## Configuring Permissions

Access the permissions menu:

```
/permissions
```

Options include:
- **Allow command** - Trust specific commands
- **Block command** - Prevent specific commands
- **Accept all edits** - Skip edit confirmations
- **Reset permissions** - Return to defaults

## Permission Patterns

You can use patterns for flexible permissions:

```
pnpm *        # Allow all pnpm commands
npm test *    # Allow all test variations
git status    # Allow specific command only
```

## Safety Considerations

### Commands to Never Auto-Allow
- `rm -rf` - Destructive deletion
- `git push --force` - Overwrite history
- Database drop commands
- Production deployments

### Safe to Auto-Allow
- Test commands
- Development servers
- Linting and formatting
- Git status/diff

## Tool Allowlists for Subagents

When creating subagents (covered later), you can restrict their tools:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]
---
```

This subagent can read code but cannot edit or run commands—perfect for review workflows.

## The LSP Tool (v2.1+)

Claude Code can access language server diagnostics:

```
Check for TypeScript errors in the project
```

Claude will use the LSP tool to find type errors, missing imports, and other diagnostics without running a build.

## Best Practices

### Start Restrictive
Begin with default permissions. Add trust as you build confidence.

### Project-Specific Permissions
Different projects need different permissions. A personal project might allow more; a production codebase should be restrictive.

### Review Permission Requests
When Claude asks permission, read what it wants to do. This is your chance to catch mistakes.

### Session Permissions
Some permissions only last for the current session. Others persist in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Practice Exercise

1. Open the permissions menu with `/permissions`
2. Allow your test command (e.g., `pnpm test`)
3. Ask Claude to run tests
4. Notice it runs without asking

## Key Takeaways

- Tools are the actions Claude can perform
- Permission modes balance safety and speed
- Start restrictive, add trust gradually
- Use patterns for flexible permissions
- Review permission requests before accepting
