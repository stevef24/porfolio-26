## Built-in Commands

Claude Code includes several built-in slash commands:

### Context Management
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/compact` - Summarize and compress context

### Configuration
- `/init` - Generate CLAUDE.md
- `/permissions` - Manage tool permissions
- `/model` - Switch between Claude models

### Features
- `/agents` - Manage subagents
- `/mcp` - Manage MCP servers
- `/help` - Show available commands

### Navigation
- `/add-dir` - Add directory to context
- `/teleport` - Jump to a different project

## The `/model` Command

Switch between models during a session:

```
/model
```

Options typically include:
- **Sonnet 4** - Fast, capable (default)
- **Opus 4.5** - Most capable, complex reasoning
- **Haiku 4.5** - Fastest, simple tasks

Choose based on task complexity:
- Haiku for quick fixes
- Sonnet for most development
- Opus for architecture decisions

## Creating Custom Commands

Create custom commands in `.claude/commands/`:

```
.claude/
  commands/
    ui-component.md
    test-coverage.md
    pr-review.md
```

### Basic Command

`.claude/commands/ui-component.md`:

```markdown
Create a new React component with these requirements:
- TypeScript with proper types
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Include unit tests
- Follow project naming conventions
```

Usage:
```
/ui-component
```

## Commands with Arguments

Add frontmatter to accept arguments:

`.claude/commands/ui-component.md`:

```markdown
---
arguments:
  - name: component name
  - description: what the component does
---

Create a new React component called $1 that $2.

Requirements:
- TypeScript with proper types
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Unit tests in __tests__ folder
- Export from components/index.ts
```

Usage:
```
/ui-component Button | handles click actions with loading state
```

The `|` separates arguments matching the frontmatter order.

## Advanced: Using $ARGUMENTS

For flexible argument handling:

`.claude/commands/generate.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Generate code based on description
---

Generate the following: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these guidelines:
- Use TypeScript
- Include error handling
- Add JSDoc comments
```

Usage:
```
/generate a utility function for debouncing
```

## Command Organization

Organize commands by purpose:

```
.claude/commands/
  # Development
  component.md      # Create components
  hook.md           # Create React hooks
  api-route.md      # Create API endpoints

  # Testing
  test.md           # Write tests
  coverage.md       # Check coverage

  # Review
  review.md         # Code review
  security.md       # Security audit
```

## Team Commands

Share commands via version control:

1. Add `.claude/commands/` to your repository
2. Team members get commands automatically
3. Standardize workflows across the team

### Example Team Commands

**`pr-description.md`**:
```markdown
Generate a PR description for the current changes.

Include:
- Summary of changes (2-3 sentences)
- List of modified files
- Testing notes
- Breaking changes (if any)
```

**`deploy-checklist.md`**:
```markdown
Review the current changes for deployment readiness:

Check for:
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No TODO comments
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Database migrations documented
```

## Built-in vs. Custom Priority

Custom commands with the same name as built-in commands override them. Be careful not to accidentally shadow important built-ins.

## Practice Exercise

1. Create `.claude/commands/` directory
2. Create a simple command (e.g., `hello.md`)
3. Test with `/hello`
4. Add arguments to make it dynamic
5. Test with `/hello YourName | your role`

## Key Takeaways

- Built-in commands handle common tasks
- Custom commands live in `.claude/commands/`
- Use arguments for flexible commands
- Share commands via version control
- `$ARGUMENTS` captures free-form input
