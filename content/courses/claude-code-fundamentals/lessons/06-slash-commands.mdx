## Your Command Line Within the Command Line

You already know keyboard shortcuts speed up your editor. Slash commands do the same thing for Claude Code. They're single-word instructions that control session state, switch models, manage tools, and more.

But here's the thing most people miss: **you don't need to memorize all of them.** There are about twenty slash commands. You'll use six of them constantly and the rest almost never.

Let's focus on what actually matters.

## The Commands You'll Use Every Day

These six commands handle 90% of your workflow control:

| Command | What it does | When to use it |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/clear` | Wipes conversation, keeps `CLAUDE.md` | Switching tasks or resetting stale context |
| `/compact` | Summarizes conversation to free space | Mid-task when context is getting full |
| `/model` | Switch between Haiku, Sonnet, Opus | Match model power to task difficulty |
| `/permissions` | Adjust what Claude can do | Tighten or loosen tool access per project |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP server connections | Check status, reconnect, toggle servers |
| `/add-dir` | Add another directory to the workspace | When your task spans multiple projects |

That's it. Master these six and you'll cover almost every session control need.

<Callout title="Key Insight">
`/clear` is the most underused command. Developers often try to "fix" a confused conversation by adding more instructions. A clean slate is almost always faster.
</Callout>

## The Commands You'll Use Sometimes

These are worth knowing but not memorizing. Glance at this list when you need them:

| Command | What it does |
| :-- | :-- |
| `/init` | Generate a starter `CLAUDE.md` for a new project |
| `/config` | Open the settings UI |
| `/cost` | Check how many tokens you've used this session |
| `/doctor` | Run a health check when something feels off |
| `/login` / `/logout` | Account management |
| `/review` | Ask Claude to review recent changes |
| `/agents` | Create or manage custom subagents |
| `/terminal-setup` | Configure terminal integration |

## Decision Framework: Which Command Do I Need?

When you're mid-session and something feels wrong, ask yourself:

**"Is Claude confused about what I want?"**
- Yes, and we just started a new task: `/clear`
- Yes, but I'm deep into the current task: `/compact` with a focusing instruction
- No, the output quality is just low: `/model` to switch to a stronger model

**"Is a tool not working?"**
- MCP server issue: `/mcp` to check status
- Permission denied: `/permissions` to adjust access
- General weirdness: `/doctor` to diagnose

**"Am I running out of context space?"**
- Early in the task: `/clear` and restart with fewer files
- Deep into a multi-step task: `/compact` to summarize and continue

## Model Switching Strategy

`/model` deserves special attention. Different tasks benefit from different models:

| Task type | Recommended model |
| :-- | :-- |
| Quick edits, renames, simple questions | **Haiku** (fast, cheap) |
| Standard feature work, bug fixes | **Sonnet** (balanced) |
| Architecture decisions, complex refactors | **Opus** (deep reasoning) |

You can switch models mid-conversation. This is powerful: start with Sonnet for exploration, switch to Opus for the hard architectural decision, then back to Sonnet for implementation.

<Callout title="Key Insight">
Model switching is about matching power to difficulty. Using Opus for a typo fix wastes tokens. Using Haiku for a complex refactor wastes time. Think of it like choosing the right tool from a toolbox.
</Callout>

## Try It Yourself

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Build the `/clear` habit.** For your next three tasks, start each one with `/clear`. Notice how much cleaner the first response is when Claude doesn't have leftover context from something unrelated.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Practice model switching.** Start a conversation with Sonnet, ask an architectural question, then switch to Opus with `/model` and ask the same question. Compare the depth of reasoning.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Create your own workflow.** Write down the three commands you think you'll use most. Pin them somewhere visible for a week. After a week, check: were they the ones you actually used?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Learned

- **Six commands** (`/clear`, `/compact`, `/model`, `/permissions`, `/mcp`, `/add-dir`) cover 90% of workflow control.
- **`/clear` is your most powerful tool** for maintaining clean context between tasks.
- **Model switching** with `/model` lets you match reasoning power to task difficulty.
- **You don't need to memorize everything.** Learn the core six, look up the rest when needed.
