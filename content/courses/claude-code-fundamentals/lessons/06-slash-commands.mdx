## Why Slash Commands Matter

Slash commands are the control panel for Claude Code. They're how you reset context, switch models, and manage integrations - fast.

## The Top 6 I Use Constantly

1. `/clear` - wipe the conversation, keep `CLAUDE.md`
2. `/compact [instructions]` - summarize when you're mid-task
3. `/model` - switch models for the task at hand
4. `/permissions` - adjust what Claude can do
5. `/mcp` - manage MCP servers and auth
6. `/add-dir` - add another directory to the workspace

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
Use `/compact` sparingly. A clean restart beats a messy summary most of the time.
</Callout>

## Also Useful (But Less Frequent)

- `/init` - generate a starter `CLAUDE.md`
- `/config` - open the settings UI
- `/cost` - check token usage
- `/doctor` - health check when things feel off
- `/login` / `/logout` - account management

## When to Use What

If you remember nothing else:
- Switching tasks? Use `/clear`.
- Deep reasoning? Switch to a stronger model.
- New tools? Add MCP only when needed.

## Key Takeaways

- Slash commands keep your workflow fast
- Master a small set and ignore the rest
- Commands are part of your context budget too
