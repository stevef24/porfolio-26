## How to Use This Appendix

This is a reference page, not a reading assignment. Here is how to get the most from it:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Bookmark the Core Docs.** The four resources in the Core Documentation table cover 80% of what you will look up.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Use the Lesson Map.** When you want to go deeper on a lesson topic, find it in the table and follow the linked docs.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Check Agent Docs Weekly.** If you use agent teams or subagents, these docs change frequently.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Contribute Back.** Found a bug? File it on GitHub. Built a useful MCP server? Share it. The community benefits from active participation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Learned (In This Whole Course)

You started with context windows and ended with production agent teams. Here is what you now know:

- **Context is everything.** Clean context produces clean output. Every lesson built on this foundation.
- **CLAUDE.md is your project's brain.** It tells Claude how to behave in your codebase.
- **Tools have tradeoffs.** Permission modes, model choices, and agent patterns all balance capability against cost and risk.
- **Automation earns its keep.** Hooks, subagents, and teams automate the repetitive so you can focus on the creative.
- **Stay current.** Claude Code evolves fast. A weekly changelog scan keeps you ahead of breaking changes.

The best way to get better is to use it. Pick a real task, apply what you have learned, and iterate. Every session makes you sharper.
