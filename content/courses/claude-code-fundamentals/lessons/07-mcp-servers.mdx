## MCP in One Sentence

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets Claude Code use tools outside the core app - databases, browsers, APIs, and more.

## The Practical Rule

Enable a **few** servers per project. The more tools you add, the more context they consume. Keep it lean.

<Callout type="info" title="A useful rule">
If a task can be done with a CLI command, prefer a command or skill. Save MCP for things that truly need it.
</Callout>

Community guides like Everything Claude Code recommend keeping only a handful of servers enabled per project for the best results.

## Manage Servers

You can manage servers from the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add <name> <command>
claude mcp list
claude mcp get <name>
claude mcp remove <name>
```

Inside Claude Code, check status with:

```
/mcp
```

## Project-Shared Config

Use a `.mcp.json` at your project root when you want the whole team to share servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_PATHS": "/Users/me/projects"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Team vs. Personal

Use `.mcp.json` when you want the whole team to share servers. Keep personal servers in your own user config when you do not want them committed to the repo.

## Key Takeaways

- MCP is powerful but expensive in context
- Keep only a few servers enabled per project
- Prefer simple CLI commands when possible
