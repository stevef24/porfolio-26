## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is Anthropic's standard for extending AI capabilities. MCP servers provide Claude with:

- **Tools** - New actions Claude can perform
- **Resources** - Data Claude can access
- **Prompts** - Specialized capabilities

Think of MCP servers as plugins that give Claude new superpowers.

## Managing MCP Servers

Access the MCP menu:

```
/mcp
```

From here you can:
- View installed servers
- Add new servers
- Configure existing servers
- Remove servers

## Server Scopes

MCP servers have three scope levels:

### Project Scope
- Stored in `.claude/settings.json`
- Available only in this project
- Checked into version control
- Best for project-specific tools

### Local Scope (Default)
- Stored in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
- Available across all projects
- Not checked into version control
- Best for personal tools

### Global Scope
- Stored in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Available everywhere
- Can be overridden by project settings
- Best for universal tools

## Essential MCP Servers

### Context7 - Documentation

Get up-to-date library documentation:

```bash
# Install via /mcp menu
npx @anthropic-ai/context7-server
```

Usage:
```
Using context7, show me how to use the new Next.js 15
App Router cache invalidation
```

Context7 fetches current documentation, solving the training cutoff problem.

### Playwright - Browser Automation

Control a browser from Claude Code:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/playwright-server
```

Usage:
```
Use Playwright to open my app at localhost:3000 and take
a screenshot of the homepage
```

Useful for:
- Visual regression testing
- Scraping for research
- UI/UX review workflows

### Filesystem (Extended)

Advanced file operations beyond built-in tools:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/filesystem-server
```

## Installing MCP Servers

### Via /mcp Menu

1. Run `/mcp`
2. Select "Add server"
3. Enter the package name
4. Choose scope

### Manual Installation

Edit your settings file:

**Local scope** (`~/.claude/settings.local.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/context7-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Project scope** (`.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/playwright-server"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSER": "chromium"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Windows Configuration

On Windows, prefix npx commands with `cmd /c`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@anthropic-ai/context7-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Server Environment

Pass environment variables to servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@company/db-server"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "${DATABASE_URL}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Environment variables from your shell are available via `${VAR_NAME}`.

## Troubleshooting MCP Servers

### Server Not Starting
- Check the command is correct
- Verify npx can access the package
- Look for errors in Claude Code output

### Server Not Responding
- Restart Claude Code
- Check server logs
- Verify network connectivity

### Tools Not Appearing
- Run `/mcp` to refresh
- Restart the session
- Check server configuration

## Building Custom MCP Servers

For advanced users, you can build custom MCP servers:

```typescript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio";

const server = new Server({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
}, {
  capabilities: {
    tools: {}
  }
});

// Define tools...

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

This is covered in advanced MCP courses.

## Practice Exercise

1. Run `/mcp` to see current servers
2. Install the context7 server
3. Ask Claude about a library using context7
4. Compare the response to asking without context7

## Key Takeaways

- MCP servers extend Claude's capabilities
- Three scopes: project, local, global
- Context7 provides current documentation
- Playwright enables browser automation
- Configure via `/mcp` or settings files
