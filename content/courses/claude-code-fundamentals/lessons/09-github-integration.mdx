## What This Enables

Claude Code can review PRs, respond to @claude mentions, and automate issue work - directly inside GitHub.

The modern path is the **Claude Code GitHub Action**, which runs on your own GitHub runners.

## Quick Start (Fastest Path)

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/install-github-app
```

This guides you through:
- Installing the GitHub app
- Adding required secrets
- Creating the workflow

## What It Can Do

- PR reviews and feedback
- Issue triage and responses
- Small code fixes and refactors
- Automated workflows (scheduled or event-based)

## Cost + Latency Reality

Every GitHub run uses tokens and takes time. For large repos:
- Expect longer runtimes
- Set limits for triggers
- Use labels or paths to reduce scope

## Key Takeaways

- GitHub integration runs via Actions
- Use `/install-github-app` for the quickest setup
- Keep automation scoped and intentional
