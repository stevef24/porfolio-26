## Claude Code GitHub App

Claude Code can integrate directly with GitHub to:

1. **Auto-review pull requests** - Provide feedback on code changes
2. **Work on issues** - Fix bugs and implement features from issue descriptions

This extends Claude Code beyond your terminal into your team's workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up, ensure:

1. **GitHub CLI installed** - [Install instructions](https://cli.github.com/)
2. **Authenticated** - Run `gh auth login`
3. **Repository access** - You need admin access to the repo

## Installation

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/install github app
```

Follow the prompts:
1. Select the repository
2. Authorize in browser
3. Choose workflows (PR review, issue handling)
4. Create the PR for GitHub Actions

This creates two GitHub Actions in your repository.

## PR Review Workflow

When you create a pull request, Claude Code automatically:

1. Analyzes the code changes
2. Checks for issues:
   - Code quality
   - Potential bugs
   - Performance concerns
   - Security vulnerabilities
3. Provides a review summary
4. Approves or requests changes

### Review Output

```
✅ Code Quality - Clean, follows conventions
✅ Bugs - No obvious issues
✅ Performance - Efficient implementation
✅ Security - No vulnerabilities detected

Overall: Approved

Minor suggestion: Consider adding error handling
for the edge case on line 42.
```

## Issue Handling Workflow

To have Claude Code work on an issue:

1. Create a GitHub issue describing the problem
2. Add a comment mentioning `@claude`
3. Claude Code creates a feature branch
4. Works on the solution
5. Provides a PR link

### Example

**Issue:** "Link from title missing - The navbar title doesn't link to homepage"

**Comment:** `@claude can you fix this?`

Claude Code will:
1. Create branch `fix/navbar-title-link`
2. Find the navbar component
3. Add the link
4. Commit changes
5. Reply with PR creation link

## Customizing Review Behavior

Configure review preferences in `.github/claude-config.yml`:

```yaml
review:
  auto_approve: false
  check_tests: true
  require_coverage: 80

focus_areas:
  - security
  - performance
  - accessibility

ignore_patterns:
  - "*.test.ts"
  - "*.spec.ts"
  - "__mocks__/**"
```

## Working with Teams

### Permissions
- Repository admins can install the app
- Team members can mention `@claude` on issues
- Reviews are visible to all collaborators

### Cost Considerations
Each review or issue response uses API credits. Consider:
- Rate limiting on busy repositories
- Restricting to certain labels
- Manual trigger only (remove auto-review)

## Advanced: Custom Actions

You can create additional GitHub Actions using Claude Code:

`.github/workflows/claude-security.yml`:
```yaml
name: Claude Security Review

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/auth/**'
      - 'src/api/**'

jobs:
  security-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          prompt: |
            Review this PR for security vulnerabilities.
            Focus on: authentication, authorization,
            input validation, and secrets exposure.
```

## Disabling Features

To disable auto-review but keep issue handling:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`
2. Change trigger from `pull_request` to `workflow_dispatch`
3. Reviews only run when manually triggered

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Not Responding to Issues
- Verify the action is enabled
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Ensure `@claude` mention is exact

### Reviews Not Appearing
- Check action workflow status
- Verify authentication token
- Review permissions in GitHub app settings

### Slow Responses
- Large PRs take longer
- Complex issues need more analysis
- Check API rate limits

## Practice Exercise

1. Install GitHub app with `/install github app`
2. Create a small PR with a simple change
3. Watch for the automatic review
4. Try creating an issue and mentioning `@claude`

## Key Takeaways

- GitHub integration adds PR review and issue handling
- Install via `/install github app`
- `@claude` mention triggers issue work
- Customize via `.github/claude-config.yml`
- Consider costs for busy repositories
