## Why CLAUDE.md Exists

Claude Code starts every session fresh. `CLAUDE.md` is how you teach it your project's DNA - once - so you don't repeat yourself every time.

The trick is to keep it lean. This file is always loaded, so anything you add competes with the rest of your context budget.

## The Fastest Way to Start

```
/init
```

Claude will scan your repo and draft a starter file. Your job is to trim and clarify.

## A Minimal, High-Signal Example

```markdown
# Project Name

Short description of what this project does.

## Stack
- Next.js 16
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

## Commands
- pnpm dev
- pnpm test
- pnpm build

## Conventions
- Components in PascalCase
- Utilities in camelCase
- No `any` types

## Never Do
- Don't write to `.env`
- Don't run destructive commands
```

## Always-On vs. Dynamic Context

Some context is permanent (`CLAUDE.md`). Some should be injected only when needed (specific files or one-off instructions). Overloading `CLAUDE.md` makes every session heavier than it needs to be.

**Rule of thumb:**
- Put invariants in `CLAUDE.md`
- Put task details in your prompt or files you add

## What to Keep Out

- Long architecture docs
- Entire API references
- One-off task details
- Outdated instructions

## Key Takeaways

- `CLAUDE.md` is the smallest set of instructions that should always apply
- Use `/init`, then delete more than you add
- Save "task context" for the prompt, not the file
