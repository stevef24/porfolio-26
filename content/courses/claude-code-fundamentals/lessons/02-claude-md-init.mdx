## Why CLAUDE.md?

Every time you start a new Claude Code session, Claude starts fresh. It doesn't remember previous conversations or your project's conventions. CLAUDE.md files solve this by providing persistent project context.

Think of CLAUDE.md as onboarding documentation for your AI assistant. Just like you'd give a new team member documentation about coding standards, architecture decisions, and project patterns, CLAUDE.md gives Claude the same context.

## Creating CLAUDE.md

You can create a CLAUDE.md file manually or use the built-in command:

```
/init
```

This command analyzes your project and generates a CLAUDE.md with:
- Detected tech stack
- Project structure
- Common commands
- Basic conventions

## CLAUDE.md Structure

A well-structured CLAUDE.md includes:

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of what this project does.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 15
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma

## Project Structure

```
app/           # Next.js App Router pages
components/    # React components
lib/           # Utility functions
prisma/        # Database schema
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev       # Start development server
pnpm build     # Production build
pnpm test      # Run tests
```

## Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Components in PascalCase
- Utilities in camelCase
- Always include JSDoc comments for public functions

## Important Notes

- Database migrations require review before applying
- Never commit .env files
- Run tests before pushing
```

## Location Hierarchy

Claude Code looks for CLAUDE.md files in multiple locations:

1. **Project root** - `./CLAUDE.md` (highest priority)
2. **User-level** - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (personal defaults)
3. **System-level** - Global configuration

Project-level instructions override user-level ones, allowing per-project customization.

## What to Include

### Always Include
- Tech stack and versions
- Project structure overview
- Common commands (dev, build, test)
- Critical conventions
- Things Claude should never do

### Consider Including
- Architecture decisions
- File naming conventions
- Testing patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Security considerations

### Avoid
- Obvious information (Claude can detect languages)
- Excessive detail (keep it scannable)
- Outdated information (maintain it)

## Advanced: Rules Directory

For larger projects, you can split instructions into `.claude/rules/`:

```
.claude/
  rules/
    testing.md      # Testing conventions
    security.md     # Security requirements
    git.md          # Git workflow
```

Claude loads all rule files automatically, keeping your CLAUDE.md focused on essentials.

## Maintenance

CLAUDE.md should evolve with your project:

- Update when tech stack changes
- Add patterns you find yourself repeating
- Remove outdated conventions
- Keep it concise—Claude has limited context

## Practice Exercise

Create a CLAUDE.md for your current project:

1. Run `/init` to generate a starting point
2. Review and customize the output
3. Add any project-specific conventions
4. Test by asking Claude about your project

## Key Takeaways

- CLAUDE.md provides persistent project context
- Use `/init` to generate a starting point
- Keep instructions concise and actionable
- Maintain it as your project evolves
- Split large configurations into `.claude/rules/`
