## The Context Window

Claude Code operates within a context window—a limited amount of information it can hold in memory at once. Everything Claude "knows" during a session lives here:

- Your conversation history
- Files Claude has read
- Command outputs
- CLAUDE.md instructions
- Tool results

When context fills up, older information gets pushed out, and Claude may lose track of earlier details.

## Why Context Management Matters

Poor context management leads to:
- Claude forgetting earlier instructions
- Repeated mistakes you've already corrected
- Slower responses as context bloats
- Higher API costs

Good context management leads to:
- Focused, accurate responses
- Faster iterations
- Lower costs
- Better results

## Monitoring Context

Watch the status bar for context usage. When you see it climbing above 70%, consider:
- Clearing context with `/clear`
- Starting a new session
- Using the `/compact` command

## The `/clear` Command

`/clear` wipes the conversation history while keeping CLAUDE.md loaded. Use it when:
- Starting a new feature
- Context has become bloated
- Claude seems confused

This is your most important context management tool.

## The `/compact` Command

`/compact` summarizes the current conversation, reducing its size while preserving key information. Use it when:
- You want to continue but context is full
- The current work isn't finished yet
- You need to preserve some history

However, `/clear` is generally preferable because compaction can lose nuance.

## Adding Context Intentionally

Use the `@` symbol to add specific files to context:

```
@src/components/Button.tsx
```

Claude will read this file and include it in context. Only add files you actually need—every file costs context space.

## Context Best Practices

### Do

- Clear context when switching tasks
- Keep CLAUDE.md concise
- Add only necessary files
- Review what Claude has in context

### Don't

- Let context bloat indefinitely
- Add entire directories unnecessarily
- Forget about context during long sessions
- Expect Claude to remember earlier sessions

## Session Workflow

A productive session typically follows this pattern:

1. **Start fresh** - New session or `/clear`
2. **Set context** - Add relevant files with `@`
3. **Work on task** - Focused prompts
4. **Complete task** - Verify changes
5. **Clear or exit** - Reset for next task

## The "One Feature, One Session" Rule

A good rule of thumb: one feature or bug fix per session. When you complete a task:
- Review the changes
- Commit if satisfied
- Clear context or start fresh

This keeps Claude focused and prevents context pollution from unrelated work.

## Shift+Enter for Multi-line Input

For complex prompts, use **Shift+Enter** to create multi-line input without sending. This helps you structure detailed requests:

```
I need to add user authentication:
- Use NextAuth.js
- Support Google and GitHub providers
- Store sessions in the database
- Add protected routes for /dashboard
```

## Practice Exercise

1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Work on a small task
3. Watch the context meter grow
4. Clear context with `/clear`
5. Notice how Claude starts fresh

## Key Takeaways

- Context is limited—manage it actively
- Use `/clear` when switching tasks
- Add files intentionally with `@`
- One feature per session is a good baseline
- Monitor context usage in the status bar
