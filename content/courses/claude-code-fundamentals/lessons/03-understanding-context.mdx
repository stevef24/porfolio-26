## Context is a Budget

Claude Code doesn't remember everything - it remembers what fits. That means every file, command output, and instruction has a cost.

When your budget is tight, you want signal, not noise.

## What Fills the Window

- Conversation history
- Files you've added
- Tool outputs (commands, reads, searches)
- `CLAUDE.md` instructions
- Active skills/commands

## Signal vs. Noise

A useful context has one job: make the next response easier to get right. Anything that doesn't help that goal is noise.

**Analogy:** Imagine a small studio desk. You only have room for the tools you're using right now. Everything else goes in a drawer.

## Clear vs. Compact

**Clear** is a reset. It removes the conversation but keeps `CLAUDE.md`.

**Compact** is a summary. It tries to keep the important details while shrinking the rest.

**Practical rule:**
- Use **Clear** between tasks
- Use **Compact** only if you're mid-task and can't restart

## Best Practices

- Plan first, then clear before execution
- Add files intentionally, one or two at a time
- Avoid re-adding big folders "just in case"
- If it feels messy, reset the session

Longform community guides (including Everything Claude Code) consistently land on the same point: fewer, sharper inputs beat more context.

## Key Takeaways

- Context is limited, and every item competes for space
- Clear is safer than compact for new work
- Clean context produces cleaner results
