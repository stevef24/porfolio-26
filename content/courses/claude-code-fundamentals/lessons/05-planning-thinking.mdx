## When to Plan vs. Execute

Not all tasks are equal. Simple changes need direct execution; complex features need planning first.

### Direct Execution
- Fix a typo
- Add a console.log
- Update a single function

### Needs Planning
- Add authentication
- Refactor multiple files
- Implement a new feature
- Anything touching 3+ files

## Planning Mode

Enable planning mode with **Alt+M** (or **Option+M** on Mac). Cycle through:

1. **Normal mode** - Direct execution
2. **Planning mode** - Creates plan before executing

In planning mode, Claude will:
1. Analyze the task
2. Identify affected files
3. Create a step-by-step plan
4. Wait for your approval
5. Execute the plan

### Example

```
[Planning Mode Enabled]

Add user authentication using NextAuth.js
```

Claude might respond:

```
## Plan

1. Install NextAuth.js and dependencies
2. Create auth configuration in lib/auth.ts
3. Add API route at app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
4. Create auth provider wrapper component
5. Add middleware for protected routes
6. Update layout to wrap app with provider

Shall I proceed with this plan?
```

You can then:
- Approve and execute
- Modify the plan
- Ask clarifying questions

## Thinking Modes

For complex reasoning without full planning, use thinking keywords:

### Keyword Levels

| Keyword | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `think` | Moderate complexity |
| `think hard` | Complex logic |
| `think harder` | Multi-step reasoning |
| `ultrathink` | Maximum reasoning depth |

### Example

```
Think hard about how to optimize this database query
```

Claude will spend more "thinking tokens" on analysis before responding.

## Planning vs. Thinking

| Planning Mode | Thinking Mode |
|---------------|---------------|
| Creates explicit plan | Deeper analysis |
| Multi-file changes | Single complex problem |
| Waits for approval | Direct response |
| Good for features | Good for debugging |

## Avoiding "Vibe Coding"

A common anti-pattern is asking for too much at once:

### Bad
```
Build me a complete e-commerce site with authentication,
payment processing, inventory management, and admin dashboard
```

### Good
```
[Planning Mode]
Let's build an e-commerce site. Start with the product
listing page. Show products from a mock data array.
```

Break large tasks into smaller, verifiable chunks:
1. Get one piece working
2. Verify it works
3. Move to the next piece
4. Repeat

## Extended Thinking for Architecture

For architectural decisions, combine planning with thinking:

```
[Planning Mode]

Think hard about the best way to structure a multi-tenant
SaaS application with Next.js. Consider:
- Database isolation strategies
- Authentication per tenant
- Subdomain routing
```

Claude will deeply analyze options before proposing a plan.

## When to Exit Planning Mode

Exit planning mode (Alt+M again) when:
- Making small, direct changes
- You already know exactly what to do
- Following an existing plan
- Quick fixes and tweaks

## Practice Exercise

1. Enable planning mode with Alt+M
2. Ask Claude to add a feature (e.g., "Add a dark mode toggle")
3. Review the generated plan
4. Modify or approve
5. Watch Claude execute step by step

## Key Takeaways

- Use planning mode (Alt+M) for multi-file changes
- Use thinking keywords for complex reasoning
- Break large tasks into smaller chunks
- Approve plans before execution
- Exit planning mode for simple changes
