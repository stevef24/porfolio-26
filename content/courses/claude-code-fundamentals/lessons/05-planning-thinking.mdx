## Plan vs. Execute

Small changes can be done directly. Anything touching multiple files deserves a plan.

**Direct execution:** fix a typo, adjust a single component, rename a variable.

**Plan first:** new features, refactors, multi-file edits.

## Planning Mode

Toggle planning mode with **Alt+M** (or **Option+M** on Mac). In planning mode, Claude will:

1. Propose a step-by-step plan
2. Wait for your approval
3. Execute only after confirmation

## Plan -> Clear -> Execute

Here's the workflow that keeps context sharp:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Plan the task.** Ask for a plan and adjust it.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Clear context.** Remove the planning discussion.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Execute the plan.** Focus on action, not debate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Thinking Keywords

Use these when you want deeper reasoning without a full plan:

- `think`
- `think hard`
- `think harder`
- `ultrathink`

## When Context Feels Noisy

If Claude starts repeating itself or ignoring your constraints:

- Clear the session
- Re-add only the two most relevant files
- Restate the task in one paragraph

## Key Takeaways

- Plan for anything that touches multiple files
- Clear context before execution
- Use thinking keywords for deep reasoning
