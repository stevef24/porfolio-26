## Start Here (Yes, Before Claude Code)

Claude Code is only as good as the context you give it. If the context is sharp, the output is sharp. If the context is noisy, the output gets fuzzy. This lesson teaches the mental model you'll use for every lesson after this one.

## What Counts as Context

Think of context as the "working memory" Claude can see during a session. It includes:

- The conversation so far
- Files you've added or opened
- Tool outputs (like command results)
- Your `CLAUDE.md` instructions
- Any active skills or command outputs

<Callout type="info" title="Why this matters">
Every item above shares the same finite budget. When the budget is full, older or less-important details get pushed out.
</Callout>

## The Context Budget

A good mental model is a backpack. You can't take everything - you choose what matters for the hike you're on.

When your context is too full, Claude starts forgetting details or mixing ideas. The fix isn't more context. It's better context.

## A Simple Context Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Start fresh.** New task, new session. Clean context.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Add only what you need.** One or two files beats a whole directory.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Do the work.** Keep prompts focused on the current task.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Clear or compact.** When the task ends, clean up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mini Exercise: Trim the Prompt

**Before**

```
Here is my whole repo. Please review all code, find issues,
rewrite the architecture, and implement all changes.
```

**After**

```
Here are two files:
- src/auth.ts
- src/middleware.ts

Please review for auth bugs and suggest fixes only.
```

Notice the difference: the second prompt makes the task possible - and keeps context focused.

## Key Takeaways

- Context is a finite budget, not an infinite library
- Clearer context beats more context
- Build a habit of starting fresh and adding only what you need
