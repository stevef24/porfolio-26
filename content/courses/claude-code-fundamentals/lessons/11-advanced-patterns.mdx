## Pattern 1: The Orchestrator

Treat your main session like a lead engineer. Delegate specialized tasks to subagents:

```
Main Session
  - planner
  - test-writer
  - code-reviewer
  - docs-writer
```

Each agent keeps its own context clean, then reports back.

## Pattern 2: Session Memory Files

When a task spans multiple sessions, save a summary file:

```
.claude/sessions/2026-02-04-auth.md
```

Include:
- what was done
- what failed
- what's next

Next session, add that file to context instead of re-explaining everything.

This pattern shows up repeatedly in community deep dives, including Everything Claude Code, because it works.

## Pattern 3: Dynamic Context Injection

Don't stuff `CLAUDE.md` with one-off details. Add task-specific files only when you need them.

**Rule:**
- `CLAUDE.md` = invariants
- prompt + files = task context

## Pattern 4: Verification Loops

For critical changes, create a simple loop:

1. Change
2. Test
3. Fix
4. Repeat

## Key Takeaways

- Delegate for clarity and speed
- Use session files to survive context resets
- Keep permanent instructions minimal
