## How Claude Code is Structured

At a high level, Claude Code is:

- **A CLI** that manages sessions, settings, and auth
- **A tool runtime** that executes Read/Edit/Bash and other actions
- **An MCP layer** that connects external tools
- **A model layer** where you choose capability vs. cost
- **A sandbox** that isolates risky commands

Understanding this structure helps you predict where new features will land.

## How to Read the Changelog

Don't read everything. Scan for items that change your workflow:

- New or changed slash commands
- Context handling or compaction tweaks
- MCP or tool-related updates
- Permission and sandbox changes
- Model or UI behavior changes

## What's New Lately (Plain English)

Here are recent changes worth knowing about:

- **PDF handling is smarter.** You can now read specific PDF page ranges, and large PDFs won't flood your context.
- **Debugging got easier.** A `/debug` command was added for session troubleshooting.
- **Model switching is immediate.** `/model` now applies right away instead of waiting in a queue.
- **Motion can be reduced.** There's a config option for reduced motion.
- **Sandbox reliability improved.** Fewer false failures when sandbox mode is enabled.
- **Tool choice improved.** Claude is steered to use file tools instead of shell equivalents, which keeps sessions cleaner.
