## How Claude Code is Structured

At a high level, Claude Code is:

- **A CLI** that manages sessions, settings, and auth
- **A tool runtime** that executes Read/Edit/Bash and other actions
- **An agent layer** for subagents and agent teams
- **An MCP layer** that connects external tools
- **A model layer** where you choose capability vs. cost
- **A sandbox** that isolates risky commands

Understanding this structure helps you predict where updates will land.

## How to Read the Changelog Fast

Don't read line-by-line. Scan for behavior changes:

- New/changed commands and flags
- Team and subagent behavior
- Model defaults and alias behavior
- Permission/sandbox updates
- Cost or context handling updates

## Last 10-Hour Snapshot (Feb 5, 2026)

This scan window ended on **February 5, 2026 at 19:20 UTC**.

### Release-level updates

- **2026-02-05T17:47:04Z - `v2.1.32` shipped**
- **Opus 4.6 became available** in Claude Code
- **Agent teams (research preview)** landed behind `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
- **Automatic memory behavior** was added (Claude records and recalls memories while working)
- **"Summarize from here"** was added to support partial conversation summarization

### Docs-level updates in the same window

- **~17:50Z** updates to `agent-teams`, `sub-agents`, `cli-reference`, and core workflow docs
- **~18:33Z** updates to `model-config`, `settings`, and `common-workflows`
- Settings now explicitly document **`teammateMode`** and CLI `--teammate-mode`
- Cost docs now explicitly call out that agent-team plan runs can use **~7x tokens** vs standard sessions

## What To Change In Your Workflow Today

1. **Update your model strategy**
Use aliases intentionally:
- `opus` for complex architecture/reasoning
- `sonnet` for day-to-day implementation
- `opusplan` when you want Opus planning and Sonnet execution

2. **Enable agent teams deliberately**
Only turn them on when collaboration between agents is needed:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  },
  "teammateMode": "in-process"
}
```

3. **Treat lead sessions as orchestrators**
When running teams, keep the lead coordinating and teammates executing.

4. **Cap team size and keep prompts tight**
Token usage scales per teammate context window, so smaller teams usually win.
