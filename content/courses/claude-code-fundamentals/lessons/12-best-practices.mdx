## The Three Principles

### 1. Always Review the Code

AI makes mistakes. Always review:
- Logic correctness
- Edge case handling
- Security implications
- Performance characteristics

Even when code "works," it might not be optimal or safe.

### 2. Stay in the Loop

If you're not reviewing Claude's output, you'll quickly lose understanding of your codebase. This matters when:
- Debugging issues manually
- Onboarding team members
- Making architectural decisions
- Maintaining long-term

AI assists; you remain responsible.

### 3. Context is Key

Be smart about context:
- Keep it focused and concise
- Clear between tasks
- Add files intentionally
- Monitor usage

Poor context leads to poor results.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Cycle through previous prompts |
| `Esc` | Clear current input |
| `Esc` `Esc` | Go to previous chat section |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation |

### Input

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift+Enter` | Multi-line input |
| `!` | Enter bash mode |
| `@` | Add file to context |
| `#` | Memorize to CLAUDE.md |

### Modes

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+M` | Toggle planning mode |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/clear` | Clear context |

### Quick Reference

Press `?` in the input area to see all available shortcuts.

## Common Workflows

### Bug Fix Workflow

```
1. /clear (fresh context)
2. @relevant-file.ts (add context)
3. Describe the bug
4. Review the fix
5. Test manually
6. Commit if good
```

### Feature Workflow

```
1. /clear
2. Alt+M (planning mode)
3. Describe the feature
4. Review and approve plan
5. Execute step by step
6. Test each step
7. Review complete feature
```

### Review Workflow

```
1. /clear
2. Ask code-reviewer agent to review
3. Receive feedback
4. Address issues
5. Request re-review
```

## What AI Can't Replace

Despite AI capabilities, human judgment remains essential for:

- **Architecture decisions** - Long-term implications
- **Business logic** - Domain expertise
- **User experience** - Empathy and intuition
- **Security** - Threat modeling
- **Ethics** - Value judgments

Use AI to accelerate, not replace, your thinking.

## The Future of Coding

AI changes how we code, not whether we code. Consider:

### New Opportunities
- MCP server development
- AI integration patterns
- Agent orchestration
- Prompt engineering

### Enduring Skills
- Problem decomposition
- System design
- Debugging intuition
- Code review

### Career Advice

Learning to code is arguably more important now because:
1. AI-generated code needs human oversight
2. AI integration requires deep understanding
3. Complex systems need experienced architects
4. Security and ethics require human judgment

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Vibe Coding
Asking for too much at once without verification.

**Fix:** Break tasks into verifiable chunks.

### Context Neglect
Letting context bloat without management.

**Fix:** Clear between tasks, monitor usage.

### Blind Trust
Accepting all AI output without review.

**Fix:** Always review, test, and verify.

### Over-Reliance
Using AI for everything, losing your skills.

**Fix:** Balance AI assistance with manual practice.

## Project Setup Checklist

For optimal Claude Code experience:

- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md with project context
- [ ] Set up `.claude/rules/` for detailed conventions
- [ ] Configure permissions for common commands
- [ ] Install relevant MCP servers
- [ ] Create project-specific agents
- [ ] Set up hooks for automation
- [ ] Document workflows in commands
- [ ] Establish session management practice

## Final Thoughts

Claude Code is a powerful tool that amplifies your capabilities. Used well, it accelerates development while keeping you in control. Used poorly, it creates technical debt and knowledge gaps.

The best practitioners:
- Treat AI as a capable junior developer
- Review everything with senior-level scrutiny
- Maintain deep understanding of their codebase
- Use AI to handle tedium, not replace thinking

Build your workflow around these principles, and Claude Code will become an invaluable part of your development toolkit.
