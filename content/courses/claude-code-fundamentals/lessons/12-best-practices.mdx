## The Four Principles

### 1. Keep Context Lean
If it won't help the next response, remove it.

### 2. Choose the Smallest Agent Pattern
Start with main session, then subagent, then agent team only when collaboration is needed.

### 3. Keep Humans on Decisions
Let agents execute, but keep plan approval and final merge decisions human-owned.

### 4. Manage Token Burn Intentionally
Parallel agents multiply token use. Keep team size and prompts tight.

## Teams + Agents Checklist

- Use subagents for focused delegation
- Use agent teams for parallel cross-role collaboration
- Enable teams explicitly (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`)
- Prefer Sonnet teammates for cost/performance balance
- Keep task ownership file-based to avoid edit collisions
- Clean up teams when done so idle teammates stop consuming tokens
- Run tests before trusting any generated change

## Final Thought

The best Claude Code workflow is not "maximum autonomy" - it's controlled delegation.
