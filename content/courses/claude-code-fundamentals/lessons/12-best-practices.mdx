## The Three Principles

### 1. Keep Context Lean
If it doesn't help the next response, remove it.

### 2. Stay in the Loop
Claude can assist, but you own the code. Always review.

### 3. Automate the Boring Parts
Hooks, commands, and subagents should remove friction - not add it.

## A Practical Checklist

- Start with a fresh session for new tasks
- Add only the files you truly need
- Use planning mode for multi-file changes
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` short and current
- Restrict tools for subagents
- Run tests before you trust a change

## Final Thought

Claude Code works best when you treat it like a fast junior developer: capable, eager, and in need of clear context and oversight.
