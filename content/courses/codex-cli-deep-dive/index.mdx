## A Practical Course for Shipping with Codex

Codex CLI is an agent for your terminal: it can read files, edit code, run commands, and review changes. But the unlock isn't a single command - it's a workflow that keeps context tight, approvals safe, and outputs reliable.

- How context windows actually work (and how to budget them)
- A clean install + config flow for teams and solo builders
