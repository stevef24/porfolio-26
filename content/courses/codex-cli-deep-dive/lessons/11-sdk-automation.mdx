## When the CLI Is Not Enough

If you want Codex inside your own product or workflow, use the Codex SDK. It lets you run tasks programmatically and integrate with your tooling.

## A Tiny SDK Mental Model

- **Threads** hold state
- **Runs** execute work inside a thread
- **Resumes** continue the same thread with new input

## GitHub Action (Easy Automation)

If you want quick automation in GitHub, use the official Codex Action. It can run reviews or tasks on PRs without local setup.
