## The 5-Step Loop

Codex works best when you run a tight loop. Think: goal -> plan -> change -> verify -> ship.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **State the goal.** One sentence, one outcome.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Add guardrails.** Scope, files, and what not to change.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Ask for a plan.** A short outline before edits.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Review the diff.** Treat the output like a PR.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Verify.** Run the smallest test that proves the change.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Prompt

```
Goal: Add a simple "/health" endpoint.
Scope: Only edit app/api/health/route.ts.
Constraints: Do not touch middleware.
Please outline a plan first.
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why this works">
This prompt sets a clear goal, a tight scope, and permission boundaries. That's what makes the output predictable.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

- Great outcomes come from a simple loop
- Ask for a plan before edits
- Always verify with a quick check
