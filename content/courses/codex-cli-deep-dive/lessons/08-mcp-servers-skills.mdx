## MCP in One Sentence

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets Codex connect to external tools - databases, APIs, browsers - when the core CLI is not enough. It supports both local stdio servers and remote servers over HTTP with OAuth.

## The Practical Rule

Enable **only a few** servers per project. Every tool adds context, and too many tools slow things down.

<Callout type="info" title="Use a tool only when needed">
If a task can be done with a normal CLI command or a skill, prefer that. Save MCP for real external systems.
</Callout>

## Manage Servers

```bash
codex mcp add <name> <command>
codex mcp list
codex mcp get <name>
codex mcp remove <name>
```

## Skills (Lightweight Reuse)

Skills are small, reusable workflows. Use them for repeated patterns that do not require external systems.

## Key Takeaways

- MCP is powerful but expensive in context
- Keep the tool list small
- Use skills for repeatable tasks
