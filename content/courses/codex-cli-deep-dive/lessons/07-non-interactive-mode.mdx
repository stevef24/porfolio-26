## Why Non-Interactive Exists

`codex exec` lets you run Codex like a script: one prompt, one output, no UI. It's perfect for CI, automations, and quick edits.

## A Simple Example

```bash
codex exec "Summarize the changes in this repo since last week"
```

## Pipe It Like Any CLI

Because output goes to stdout, you can chain it:

```bash
codex exec "Generate a concise release summary" > RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

## Keep It Safe

For automation, pair `codex exec` with a strict approval policy and a safe sandbox:

```bash
codex exec --ask-for-approval untrusted --sandbox workspace-write "Update the README summary"
```

<Callout type="info" title="Be explicit">
Non-interactive runs are strict. Keep prompts narrow and give clear constraints.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

- `codex exec` is ideal for scripts and CI
- Keep prompts tight and specific
- Treat output like you would any generated artifact
