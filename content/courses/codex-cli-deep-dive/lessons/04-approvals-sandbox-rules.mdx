## Why This Matters

Codex can run commands and edit files. Approvals and sandboxing are how you decide **what's allowed** and **where it's allowed**.

<InlineTOC />

## Approval Modes (The Guardrails)

Codex offers three approval modes in the TUI:

- **Auto** (default): Codex decides when to ask
- **Read-only**: no file writes, no risky commands
- **Full access**: no prompts (only for trusted repos)

Use read-only until you're confident in the workflow.

## Sandbox Modes (Where Commands Run)

- **read-only**: no file writes
- **workspace-write**: write only inside the repo
- **danger-full-access**: write anywhere (avoid unless you must)

## CLI Flags That Matter

When you run Codex from the CLI, the key flags are:

- `--ask-for-approval` to control approvals
- `--sandbox` to control where commands can write
- `--full-auto` to run with workspace-write and fewer prompts
- `--yolo` to bypass approvals and sandboxing (avoid unless you must)

## Rules Files (Extra Safety)

If you need stricter control, use rules to allow or deny specific commands. This is your last line of defense.

<Callout type="info" title="Practical default">
Start with strict approvals + workspace-write. Only loosen after you trust the workflow.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

- Approvals control **what** can run
- Sandbox controls **where** it can run
- Use rules when you need tighter guarantees
