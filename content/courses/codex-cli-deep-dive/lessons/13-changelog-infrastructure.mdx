## How Codex CLI Is Structured

At a high level, Codex CLI is an open-source Rust app that provides:

- **Interactive CLI** for day-to-day work
- **Non-interactive runs** via `codex exec`
- **MCP integration** for external tools
- **Codex Cloud** for remote tasks
- **SDKs** for programmatic workflows

The takeaway: most features are layers on top of the same core engine.

## How to Read the Changelog

Scan for changes that affect your workflow:

- Default model changes
- New permissions or approvals behavior
- Changes to config precedence
- New commands or flags
- Skill/MCP changes

Ignore internal refactors unless they affect behavior.

## What's New (Latest Highlights)

Here are the most user-impacting updates in the recent Codex changelog:

- **Jan 28, 2026** - Web search is enabled by default for local tasks. Cached results are used by default, with live search when full access is enabled. You can change this with `web_search = "cached" | "live" | "disabled"`.
- **Jan 23, 2026** - Team Config was added to share `config.toml`, `rules/`, and `skills/` across repos and machines, with `requirements.toml` enforcing constraints.
- **Jan 22, 2026** - Custom prompts were deprecated in favor of skills.
- **Jan 22, 2026 (CLI 0.89)** - `/permissions` was added alongside `/approvals`, plus a new skill UI.

If you update Codex CLI regularly, this is the section to scan first.

## Key Takeaways

- Most changes affect **defaults**, not your prompts
- Track the changelog monthly, not daily
- Prefer skills over custom prompts going forward
