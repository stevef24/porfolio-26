## Why This Matters

Codex can review code like a teammate - but only if you give it clear rules. That's where `AGENTS.md` comes in.

## The Review Loop

1. Add review guidelines in `AGENTS.md`
2. Trigger review on a PR via the Codex GitHub Action
3. Keep feedback focused on real risk (P0/P1)

<Callout type="info" title="Keep rules close to code">
Codex follows instructions based on proximity. Put `AGENTS.md` near the code it governs.
</Callout>

## What to Put in `AGENTS.md`

- The project's risk boundaries (security, data, auth)
- What *not* to change
- Tests that must be run

## GitHub Action (Fastest Automation)

OpenAI ships a Codex GitHub Action that can review PRs automatically. This is the fastest way to add Codex review to a team workflow without running the CLI locally.

## Key Takeaways

- `AGENTS.md` is your review contract
- Keep review rules short and local
- Use Codex reviews for focused, high-signal feedback
