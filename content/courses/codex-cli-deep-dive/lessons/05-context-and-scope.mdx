## Why Scope Wins

Codex isn't magic - it's a fast reader. The smaller the reading list, the better the answers.

## The Scope Playbook

- Add **only** the files you need
- Avoid adding entire repos unless you're doing exploration
- Keep `AGENTS.md` short and specific

## Add a Second Directory (Only When Needed)

If you need a second project folder, add it explicitly:

```bash
codex --add-dir /path/to/other/project
```

## The "One-Screen Rule"

If you wouldn't open it in your editor, don't add it to context. That one habit keeps sessions clean.

<Callout type="info" title="Context is shared">
Conversation, files, and tool outputs all compete for the same budget. The cleaner it is, the better Codex behaves.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

- Scope is the real power lever
- Add only the files you need
- Short, clear rules outperform long ones
