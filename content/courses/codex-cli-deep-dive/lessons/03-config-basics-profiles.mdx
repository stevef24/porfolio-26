## Why Config Matters

Config turns Codex from a toy into a tool. It's where you set defaults for models, approvals, and sandboxing so every session starts the same way.

<InlineTOC />

## Where Config Lives

Codex reads configuration from multiple layers:

- **System defaults** (installed with the CLI)
- **User config**: `~/.codex/config.toml`
- **Project config**: `.codex/config.toml` (trusted projects only)
- **CLI flags** and `-c key=value` overrides

Project config is only loaded after you trust the repo in Codex.

## Precedence (Who Wins?)

Highest wins:

1. CLI flags and `-c` overrides (this run only)
2. Profile settings (if you pass `--profile`)
3. Project config (`.codex/config.toml`, closest to your current folder wins)
4. User config (`~/.codex/config.toml`)
5. System defaults

## Profiles (When You Need Different Defaults)

Profiles let you switch setups without editing files. Example use-cases:

- **Deep work**: slower model, higher reasoning
- **Daily edits**: fast model, strict approvals
- **CI**: non-interactive, safe sandbox

Use a profile with:

```bash
codex --profile deep-work
```

## Key Takeaways

- Put durable defaults in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Use project config for shared team rules
- CLI flags are for one-off overrides
