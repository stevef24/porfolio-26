## The Top 6

1. `codex` - start the interactive CLI
2. `codex exec` - run a task non-interactively
3. `codex resume` - continue the last session
4. `codex mcp` - manage MCP servers
5. `codex cloud` - browse or apply cloud tasks
6. `codex apply` - apply a diff from Codex Cloud

## Also Useful

- `codex login` / `codex logout` - account management
- `codex fork` - branch from a previous session
- `codex completion` - shell completions
- `codex features` - feature flags

<Callout type="info" title="Minimalism wins">
If you only remember one thing: learn `codex`, `codex exec`, and `codex apply`. Everything else is occasional.
