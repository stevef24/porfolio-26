## Principles

- **Scope beats speed.** Smaller tasks produce better results.
- **Plan before edits.** Ask for a plan on anything non-trivial.
- **Treat outputs like PRs.** Review every diff.
- **Automate only what you trust.** Start strict, loosen slowly.

## A Minimal Checklist

- Is the scope one outcome?
- Are the right files in context?
- Did I set clear constraints?
- Did I verify the change?

## Key Takeaways

- Small scope = big reliability
- Plan first, change second
- Verify every output
