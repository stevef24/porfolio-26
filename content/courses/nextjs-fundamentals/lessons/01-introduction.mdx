## Welcome to Next.js

Next.js has evolved from a simple React framework to a full-stack solution for building web applications. The App Router, introduced in Next.js 13, represents a fundamental shift in how we think about React applications.

### Why Next.js?

The framework solves several challenges that React developers face:

- **Routing** - File-based routing eliminates manual route configuration
- **Rendering** - Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
- **Data Fetching** - Native async/await in components simplifies data loading
- **Optimization** - Built-in image, font, and script optimization

### The App Router Mental Model

Think of your `app` directory as a tree of UI segments. Each folder represents a route segment, and special files like `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` define how that segment renders.

```
app/
├── layout.tsx      # Root layout (wraps everything)
├── page.tsx        # Home page (/)
└── blog/
    ├── layout.tsx  # Blog layout (wraps blog pages)
    └── page.tsx    # Blog index (/blog)
```

### Try it in the browser

Edit the component below and see the result update instantly.

<CodePlayground
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": `export default function App() {
  return (
    <main style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-sans)" }}>
      <h1>Hello Next.js</h1>
      <p>Update this text to see live changes.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
`
  }}
/>

### Key Concepts

1. **Server Components** are the default - they run on the server and send HTML
2. **Client Components** opt-in with `"use client"` - they hydrate on the browser
3. **Layouts** persist across navigations - they don't remount

In the next lesson, we'll set up a project and explore these concepts hands-on.
