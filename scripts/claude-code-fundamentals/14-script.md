# Video Script: Appendix & Resources
Duration: 3 min estimated

## Hook (15 sec)
**Show on screen:** A browser with 20 tabs of Claude Code docs open, looking overwhelming
**Say:** "There are dozens of documentation pages. You need four of them. Let me show you which ones to bookmark and which ones to ignore."

## Setup (15 sec)
**Show on screen:** Clean browser with just four bookmarks
**Say:**
- This is the reference episode. We'll cover the resources that matter most, how to find what you need fast, and a recap of the entire course.

## Main Content

### The Four Core Bookmarks
**Show on screen:** Browser, navigating to each one
**Say:**
- These four cover 80% of what you'll ever look up:
**Demo:** Open each in a new tab:
1. **Claude Code Docs** -- "First stop for 'how does X work?' Start here."
2. **CLI Reference** -- "Every command, flag, and option. When you need exact syntax."
3. **Changelog** -- "What shipped and when. Your weekly scan target."
4. **Settings Reference** -- "All configuration options. Check this when setting up a new project."
- Bookmark all four. Close everything else.

### When to Check Agent Docs
**Show on screen:** Agent Teams documentation page
**Say:**
- If you use agent teams or subagents, the Agent Teams and Subagents docs evolve fast
- Check these weekly alongside the changelog
- They're the fastest-moving part of the documentation

### The Course Recap
**Show on screen:** Animated summary cards for each module, flipping through
**Say:**
- Let's do a speed recap of everything you learned in this course:

**Context (Lessons 0-1):** Context is a budget. Clean context produces clean output. Start fresh often.

**Foundations (Lessons 2-4):** CLAUDE.md is your project's brain. Trim it hard. Permissions start strict, relax with evidence.

**Core Features (Lessons 5-7):** Plan before multi-file work. Six slash commands cover 90% of workflow control. MCP servers are powerful but expensive in context.

**Power Features (Lessons 8-10):** Subagents trade tokens for context cleanliness. GitHub integration automates the first review pass. Hooks are your safety net and automation layer.

**Production Patterns (Lessons 11-12):** Choose the simplest topology. Keep leads out of implementation. Gate risky changes. Session memory files prevent re-work.

**Staying Current (Lesson 13):** Weekly changelog scan, five categories, two minutes. Update CLAUDE.md when things shift.

## Exercise Walkthrough (30 sec)
**Show on screen:** The four bookmarks
**Say:**
- Bookmark the four core docs
- Set your weekly changelog reminder if you haven't already
- Pick one lesson concept you haven't tried yet and use it in your next Claude Code session
- The best way to get better is to use it on real tasks

## Wrap Up (30 sec)
**Say:** "You started with context windows and ended with production agent teams. The single thread through all of it: sharp context produces sharp output. Every tool, every pattern, every principle in this course serves that idea. Now go build something. Pick a real task, apply what you learned, and iterate. Every session makes you sharper."
**Show on screen:** Course completion card with the five key takeaways from the lesson:
- Context is everything
- CLAUDE.md is your project's brain
- Tools have tradeoffs
- Automation earns its keep
- Stay current
