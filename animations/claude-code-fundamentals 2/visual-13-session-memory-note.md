# Visual 13 - Session Memory Note

Lesson: `content/courses/claude-code-fundamentals/lessons/11-advanced-patterns.mdx`
Placement: After "Session Memory Files"

## Goal
Make the memory file pattern feel lightweight and easy.

## Why This Visual
Readers think this is heavy documentation work. A simple note makes it approachable.

## What It Must Communicate
- The summary is short.
- It captures only what matters.
- It is reusable across sessions.

## Narrative (Steps)
1. A blank note card appears.
2. Title types in: "Session Summary".
3. Three bullets appear one-by-one: Done, Blocked, Next.

## Layout
- Note card centered with subtle border and slight shadow.
- Bullets aligned left and short.

## Motion
- Simple typing cursor for the title.
- Bullet points fade in with a small stagger.

## Interaction
- Optional: click the note to expand one example entry.

## Reduced Motion
- Static note with full text visible.

## Implementation Notes
- Suggested component name: `SessionMemoryNote`.
- Keep the note clean and minimal.
- Avoid sticky-note visuals that feel playful; keep it professional.
