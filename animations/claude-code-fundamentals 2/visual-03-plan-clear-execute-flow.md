# Visual 03 - Plan -> Clear -> Execute Flow

Lesson: `content/courses/claude-code-fundamentals/lessons/05-planning-thinking.mdx`
Placement: After "Plan -> Clear -> Execute" steps

## Goal
Make the workflow rhythm easy to remember and repeat.

## Why This Visual
The plan/clear/execute concept is a key habit. A visual sequence anchors it.

## What It Must Communicate
- Planning is separate from execution.
- Clearing is the reset that protects execution quality.
- Sequence matters.

## Narrative (Steps)
1. Three tiles appear: Plan, Clear, Execute.
2. Plan tile highlights and an arrow animates to Clear.
3. Clear tile highlights, then arrow moves to Execute.
4. Execute tile finishes with a subtle glow.

## Layout
- Three equally sized tiles in a row.
- Arrows between tiles.
- Short caption below: "Keep planning context out of execution."

## Motion
- Sequential highlight with short pulses.
- Arrows animate in order.

## Interaction
- Optional play button to replay the sequence.
- Default state should show the full flow even without interaction.

## Reduced Motion
- Static tiles with a numbered label: 1 Plan, 2 Clear, 3 Execute.

## Implementation Notes
- Suggested component name: `PlanClearExecuteFlow`.
- Use one accent color for the active tile.
- Keep arrow line weight consistent with other visuals.
