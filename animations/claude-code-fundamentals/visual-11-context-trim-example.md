# Visual 11 - Context Trim Example

Lesson: `content/courses/claude-code-fundamentals/lessons/00-context-primer.mdx`
Placement: After "Mini Exercise: Trim the Prompt"

## Goal
Make the difference between a bloated prompt and a focused prompt obvious.

## Why This Visual
The text example is good but still abstract. A visual contrast locks in the lesson.

## What It Must Communicate
- "Before" is dense and costly.
- "After" is concise and actionable.

## Narrative (Steps)
1. Two cards appear side-by-side: Before and After.
2. Before shows dense text and a larger context meter.
3. After shows short text and a smaller meter.
4. The After card subtly brightens to emphasize the better choice.

## Layout
- Two equal width cards.
- Meters aligned beneath each text block.

## Motion
- Fade in both cards.
- After card gains a slight glow or emphasis.

## Interaction
- Optional: toggle between "Show noise" and "Show signal" to highlight differences.

## Reduced Motion
- Static side-by-side cards with both meters visible.

## Implementation Notes
- Suggested component name: `ContextTrimComparison`.
- Keep the text short to avoid real content bloat.
- Use minimal color; rely on density and spacing.
