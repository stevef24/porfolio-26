# Visual 12 - Permissions Safety Ladder

Lesson: `content/courses/claude-code-fundamentals/lessons/04-tools-permissions.mdx`
Placement: After "The Permission Model"

## Goal
Show progressive trust levels for permissions.

## Why This Visual
Permissions are easy to misread. The ladder clarifies safe progression.

## What It Must Communicate
- Default is safest.
- Allow commands is a moderate step.
- Accept edits is the highest trust.

## Narrative (Steps)
1. Ladder appears with three rungs.
2. Highlight moves from Default to Allow Commands.
3. Highlight moves to Accept Edits.

## Layout
- Vertical ladder on the left, labels on the right.
- Small icon per rung (shield, check, pencil).

## Motion
- Highlight slides upward with a short ease.

## Interaction
- Optional: hover each rung to see a one-line caution.

## Reduced Motion
- Static ladder with rungs labeled and a single highlight.

## Implementation Notes
- Suggested component name: `PermissionsSafetyLadder`.
- Keep icon style consistent with the rest of the system.
- Avoid bright warning colors; keep tone calm.
