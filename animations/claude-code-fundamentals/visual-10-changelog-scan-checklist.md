# Visual 10 - Changelog Scan Checklist

Lesson: `content/courses/claude-code-fundamentals/lessons/13-changelog-infrastructure.mdx`
Placement: After "How to Read the Changelog"

## Goal
Turn changelog reading into a quick, repeatable habit.

## Why This Visual
Readers need a scan method, not a full read. This visual anchors the checklist.

## What It Must Communicate
- There are 5 key categories to scan.
- Each category is short and actionable.

## Narrative (Steps)
1. A 2x3 grid of cards appears.
2. Cards label the categories: Commands, Context, Tools, MCP, Permissions.
3. Checkmarks animate in sequence.

## Layout
- Card grid with icons and short labels.
- One empty slot for balance if needed.

## Motion
- Checkmarks appear with a soft scale-in.
- Small stagger between checkmarks.

## Interaction
- Optional: clicking a card reveals a micro-tip example.

## Reduced Motion
- Static grid with checkmarks already visible.

## Implementation Notes
- Suggested component name: `ChangelogScanChecklist`.
- Keep icons consistent with site icon set.
- Use one accent color for checkmarks.
