## What Works (From Emil)
- Animation should be purposeful, not decorative. If it has no purpose, remove it. [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/you-dont-need-animations)
- UI animations should be fast; Emil suggests staying under ~300ms for most UI motion. [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/you-dont-need-animations)
- Frequency matters: the more often the user sees the animation, the more minimal it should be. [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/you-dont-need-animations)
- Great animations should be interruptible (users should not feel stuck waiting for a timeline). [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/great-animations)

## What Does Not Work
- Decorative or long animations that slow repeated workflows. [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/you-dont-need-animations)
- Animations that are not interruptible when users need to act quickly. [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/great-animations)

## How We Will Apply This
- Keep every visual short and focused on a single concept.
- Use short durations and avoid long loops.
- Ensure interactive visuals can be interrupted or reset.
