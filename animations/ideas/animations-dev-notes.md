# animations.dev - Notes for Visual Style

Source: animations.dev public landing page

## What Stood Out
- The course focuses on theory and practice, not just snippets. [animations.dev](https://animations.dev/)
- It is positioned as an interactive learning experience. [animations.dev](https://animations.dev/)
- It highlights easing, timing, and spring animations as core topics. [animations.dev](https://animations.dev/)
- The message is about creating animations that "feel right" instead of decoration. [animations.dev](https://animations.dev/)

## How We Will Apply This
- Every visual should teach one concept, then prove it with motion.
- Use short transitions to show cause -> effect.
- Keep visuals minimal and focused on the idea, not the effect.
- Add interactivity only when it clarifies a choice (ex: easing or timing).

## Open Item
- The /learn content is gated. If you want deeper alignment, share screenshots or access and we can refine.
